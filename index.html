          <p>
            Red Bull were no strangers to F1 - as sponsors - prior to formally entering as a 
            works team in 2004. Nonetheless, the scale of their success over the following 
            decade was staggering. After a first podium in 2006, the team hit their stride 
            in 2009, claiming six victories and second in the constructors' standings. Over 
            the next four seasons they were a tour de force, claiming consecutive title doubles 
            between 2010 and 2013, with Sebastian Vettel emerging as the sport's youngest 
            quadruple champion. Now they are recapturing that glory with an equally exciting 
            talent – one named Max Verstappen…

            <p>
              Mercedes’ modern F1 revival started with the creation of a works squad for 2010 - 
              the platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. The team generated huge 
              excitement from the off with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but
              headlines soon followed on track: three podiums in their debut season, all via 
              Nico Rosberg - who then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 
              2012. The following season he was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo going on to 
              stage some epic title battles as the Silver Arrows swept all before them to become 
              one of the most dominant forces of the modern F1 era. And with Hamilton now 
              partnered by the up-and-coming George Russell, Mercedes remain very much the team 
              that everyone wants to beat…

            <p>For many, Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have become inseparable. The only team to 
              have competed in every season since the world championship began, the Prancing Horse 
              has grown from the humble dream of founder Enzo Ferrari to become one of the most 
              iconic and recognised brands in the world. Success came quickly through the likes 
              of Alberto Ascari and John Surtees, and continued – in amongst leaner times – with 
              Niki Lauda in the 1970s and then Michael Schumacher in the 2000s, when Ferrari 
              claimed a then unprecedented five consecutive title doubles, securing their status 
              as the most successful and decorated team in F1 history...

            <p>Aston Martin’s original Formula 1 foray – over half a century ago – lasted 
            just five races. This time, though, it’s serious. This F1 squad are no strangers 
            to success, having won in their original guise of Jordan and most recently as Racing 
            Point in 2020. Renowned for their ability to punch above their weight, and now with a 
            two-time champion leading their driver line-up, Aston Martin are very much a team to watch…

            <p>Since entering the sport in 1966 under the guidance and restless endeavour of 
            eponymous founder Bruce, McLaren's success has been nothing short of breathtaking. 
            Five glittering decades have yielded countless victories, pole positions and 
            podiums, not to mention eight constructors' championships. What's more, some of 
            the sport's greatest drivers made their names with the team, including Emerson 
            Fittipaldi, Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton...

            <p>
            Alpine may be a relatively new name to Formula 1, but Renault’s famous sportscar 
            arm has plenty of motorsport heritage. The 2021 rebrand of the team marked the 
            next step in Renault’s F1 revival, begun in 2016 with the takeover of the 
            then-Lotus squad. Already race winners in their new guise, regular podiums and a 
            tilt at the title must be their next target…

            <p>
            Driven on by the brilliance and passion of the late Sir Frank Williams, Williams 
            grew from humble beginnings to become a Formula 1 behemoth, unrivalled by all 
            except Ferrari and McLaren in terms of enduring success. Over the past four 
            decades the team has racked up Grand Prix wins and championship glory, and in 
            the process nurtured some of the greatest talents in the sport, both in and out 
            the cockpit. And, following the Williams family's decision to step aside after 
            the 2020 sale of the team to Dorilton Capital, a new era has begun...

            <p>
            The youngest team on the grid, Haas made their highly impressive debut in 2016, 
            and in the process became the first all-American-led F1 squad in three decades. 
            Founded by industrialist Gene Haas, they are based in the United States on the 
            same Kannapolis, North Carolina facility as his championship-winning NASCAR 
            Sprint Cup Series team, Stewart-Haas Racing. The Ferrari-powered team, led by 
            the charismatic Guenther Steiner, also have a UK factory in Banbury…

            <p>
            The name Alfa Romeo boasts Formula 1 connections dating back to the championship’s 
            inception in 1950. Fast forward to the 21st century and Italian flare combines 
            with Swiss sensibilities in a new era for the team formerly known as Sauber.
            Having enjoyed considerable success in world sportscars, where he helped nurture 
            the emerging talents of future F1 stars Michael Schumacher and Heinz-Harald 
            Frentzen, Peter Sauber guided his eponymous squad into F1 in 1993.The team has 
            since established itself as a mainstay of the grid, becoming race winners under 
            BMW’s brief ownership, and developing a well-earned reputation not only for 
            producing competitive cars, but also for developing young drivers.
